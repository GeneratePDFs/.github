# GeneratePDFs

Welcome to GeneratePDFs. This is the service that helps you turn HTML into clean, consistent PDFs through a simple API. If you can create it with HTML you can turn it into a PDF. That includes invoices, tickets, reports, receipts, certificates, order summaries and anything else you want your users to download or print.

The goal of GeneratePDFs is to make PDF creation feel predictable and easy to fit into any project. You bring the HTML and we return a finished PDF file.

## Getting started

Sign up at **https://generatepdfs.com** and you can begin generating PDFs straight away. The dashboard lets you upload HTML files, preview your output and create PDFs without writing any code. This is a great way to confirm your HTML looks correct and to test different layouts or styles.

You can also view your previous generations and keep track of your usage directly from the dashboard. Once you are familiar with how your PDFs look, you can move on to using the API if you want to automate the process.

## API usage

To integrate PDF creation into your own system, visit your dashboard and create an API token. This token lets you make authenticated requests from your application.

The API page includes ready to use examples for CURL, PHP, Ruby, Node and Go. These show how to send HTML or a URL and receive a PDF link in response.

Alternatively, use one of our SDKs to get up and running quicker and easier.
